# Algorithms

This section is dedicated to showcasing my solutions to various algorithmic challenges.
Here, you will find a collection of problems that range from basic sorting and searching techniques to more complex algorithmic strategies like divide and conquer, greedy methods, and graph algorithms.

## Problem Categories

- [Sorting Algorithms](Sorting/): Solutions focusing on different techniques and strategies for arranging data in a specific order.
- Searching Algorithms: Solutions centered around efficiently finding elements within a dataset.
- Graph Algorithms: Problems that involve graph traversal, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and graph-related optimizations.
- Greedy Algorithms: Challenges where greedy strategies are used for optimization problems.
- Divide and Conquer: Solutions that involve breaking down problems into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and combining their results.
- [Dynamic Programming](Dynamic/): Problems that involve breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
