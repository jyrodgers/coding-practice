## Features

- **Diverse Problem Set**: Solutions cover a wide range of topics including data structures, algorithms, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Google Test Integration**: Each solution includes thorough test cases using the Google Test framework, ensuring code reliability and correctness.
- **Build Systems**: Solutions are organized to be built using either CMake or Bazel, providing flexibility and demonstrating familiarity with modern C++ build tools.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine.
You can build and run the solutions and their tests using either CMake or Bazel.

### Building with CMake

1. Configure and build the project:

From the root directory run these commands:

```
mkdir build; cmake -S . -B build; cmake --build build
```

### Building with Bazel

To build:

```
bazel build //...
```

To run the tests:

```
bazel test //...
```

## Problem Categories

This repository is organized into various categories, each focusing on a specific area of programming challenges.
Below, you'll find links to each category along with a brief description of what to expect in each.

### Data Structures

Challenges that emphasize the use and manipulation of different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, and graphs.
Ideal for understanding the foundational elements of programming.

### [Algorithms](Algorithms/)

Problems focusing on algorithmic techniques like sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
These challenges help sharpen problem-solving and computational thinking.

### Dynamic Programming
Challenges that require dynamic programming strategies, ideal for understanding optimization problems and learning how to approach problems that involve breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.

### Database Queries

Problems that involve writing efficient and optimized database queries, primarily focusing on SQL.
These challenges are great for those who want to enhance their database management skills.

### System Design

This section contains problems related to designing large-scale systems, focusing on aspects like scalability, system architecture, and design patterns.
